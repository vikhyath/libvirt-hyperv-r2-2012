         LibVirt : simple API for virtualization

  Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software
available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of
the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic
resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aim at providing
long term stable C API initially for the Xen paravirtualization but
should be able to integrate other virtualization mechanisms if needed.

Please Note: If possible, this code will merged as a patch into the main libvirt library codebase.
Hence, please make sure you always refer to the original source available at http://libvirt.org/.
This is a intermediate ground for patching up libvirt to add support for Hyper-V 2012 r2.

The libvirt library has been downloaded and built with the following drivers. You can use virsh at tools/
or use the object files (.so) or static libraries (.la) under src/.libs

[user@localhost tools]# ./virsh -V
Virsh command line tool of libvirt 1.2.4
See web site at http://libvirt.org/

Compiled with support for:
 Hypervisors: QEMU/KVM LXC UML OpenVZ VMWare VirtualBox ESX Hyper-V Test
 Networking: Remote Network Bridging Interface udev Nwfilter VirtualPort
 Storage: Dir Filesystem SCSI Multipath LVM
 Miscellaneous: Daemon Nodedev SELinux Secrets Debug Modular
